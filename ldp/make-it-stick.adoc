# Make It Stick

## Learning is misunderstood
- a lot of unproved misconceptions
- best habit is regular self-quiz to recalibrate
- summary of techniques
  * retrieval practice
  * low-stakes quizzing and self-testing
  * spacing out practice
  * interleaving the practice of different but relate topics/skills
  * trying to solve a problem before being thought the solution
  * distilling the underlying principles/rules that differentiate types of problems

## To Learn, Retrieve
- Practice at retrieving new knowledge of skill from memory is a potent tool for learning and durable retention
- Effortful retrieval makes for stronger learning and retention
  * after an initial test _delaying_ subsequent retrieval practice is more potent than immediate practice because delayed retrieval requires more effort
- repeated retrieval helps
- testing doesn't need to be initiated by the instructor (self flashcards)

## Mix Up Your Practice
- _space_ out study and practice (enough time that a little forgetting sets in)
- Leitner box flashcards system
- _interleaving_: switch before each practice is complete
- _varied_ practice: don't repeat/redo in same order (reflection is a form of this)

## Embrace difficulties
- Learning is a 3-step process
  * encoding
  * consolidation
  * retrieval
- The more repeated use of something more memory connections are made
- Repeated _effortful_ recall or practice build mental models

## Avoid Illusions of Knowing
- Lots of traps: Dunning-Kruger effect, curse of knowledge etc
- The anecdote about police office disarming incident
- Tools and Habits for calibrating own judgement: peer instruction, cues to judge own learning, feedback etc

## Get Beyond Learning Styles
- Lots of models that can be misleading
- Be the one in charge
- Embrace the notion of successful intelligence
- _Adopt active learning strategies_ (retrieval practice, spacing, interleaving)
  * like those with dyslexia who have become high achievers, develop _workarounds_ or _compensating_ skills for impediments or holes in your aptitudes
- Distil the underlying principles: build the structure

## Increase Your Abilities
- Nothing is set in stone or at birth - _growth mindset_
- Various mnemonic techniques (like memory palace)
- _self-discipline_ + _grit_ + _persistence_

## Make It Stick
- Various teaching for different targets: students, life-long learners, teachers, instructors etc
- One good insight https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/29/draft-no-4
  * _start_ something, have a draft, and then it's easier to engage with it
